# JAVA_DSA
I'm using Java for implementing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) because it offers powerful standard libraries, object-oriented features, and platform independence. Java provides built-in data structures like ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, and TreeMap, which streamline the development of complex algorithms. 


java -c Main.java // compiling the file convert into bytecode
java Main // running the file
java -d Main.java // changing the file directory
where javac // checking the java path
