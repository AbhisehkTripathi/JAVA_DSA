# JAVA_DSA
I'm using Java for implementing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) because it offers powerful standard libraries, object-oriented features, and platform independence. Java provides built-in data structures like ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, and TreeMap, which streamline the development of complex algorithms.
